# Laberinto

*A labyrinth game I started to test out the ClanLib library*

Yet another labyrinth game. If you have seen all my projects you are probably starting to thing this
is some fetish of mine. Anyway, this is just some work with the ClanLib library.

## Build instructions

This project would not compile out of the box, you need to download and place the ClanLib in the compiler
paths. Not sure if it would be still compatible with the current ClanLib release.
